                                    <ul>
                                      <li><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> The Pre-diapin sequence is highly important to cause a readthrough.<br>
                                      <em>Argument:</em> The high conservation of the sequence observed in the co-evolutionary study suggests it has a key role in the readthrough's function.</li>

                                      <li><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong> The Diapin structure is important to cause a readthrough.<br>
                                      <em>Argument:</em> The Diapin region's structure shows high conservation from the co-evolutionary study, and whilst it does not necessarily conserve 
                                                the exact sequence, it conserves complementary pairings that maintain its secondary structure as predicted by bioinformatic tools.</li>

                                      <li><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong> The Hypopin's sequence and structure might play a small role in the function of the readthrough.<br>
                                      <em>Argument:</em> The results of the co-evolutionary study do not show high conservation of the sequence, suggesting a lower importance in the function of the readthrough.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>To confirm the aforementioned hypotheses, we generated constructs that either maintain or eliminate certain regions of the stop codon readthrough element, or that modify sequences but preserve secondary structure. Below are the designs:</p>

                                    The design of the plasmid includes a Dual-Luciferase reporter system, by which the level of the second luciferase (Firefly), is expressed due to the presence of readthrough. 
                                    This way we can determine the readthrough rate by comparing the expression of the first luciferase (Renilla) and the second luciferase (Firefly). Two T2A peptides flank the Mod SCR-D,
                                     so that the final Luciferase peptides’ signals are not affected by its presence or each other.

                                design: `Building on the previous learning, we needed a highly effective and validated aptamer variant. After a thorough review, we chose the Theo-ON-5 variant [13]. 
                                        This specific aptamer was selected because it demonstrated the largest difference in frameshift percentage (the ON/OFF ratio) in a conceptually similar published study.
                                         We hypothesized that by using this robust and experimentally validated variant, we could maximize the efficiency of our synthetic switch. This swich’s inner workings rely on the 
                                         Frameshift’s function being caused by its structure. When theophylline binds to the aptamer, the aptamer’s structure changes, disrupting the Frameshift and therefore the Frameshift rates.`,
                                build: `We constructed a plasmid containing the Theo-ON-5 aptamer, linked to a -1 Programmed Ribosomal Frameshift Pseudoknot [13]. This Aptamer-Frameshift component is a ligand-responsive ON-ON RNA switch, and it will allow us to test the aptamer’s working conditions. The frameshift occurs when the aptamer binds its ligand (theophylline)
                                        This construct contains a Dual-Luciferase reporter system, where the second luciferase (Firefly) is only synthetised in the right frame when the frameshift occurs. Otherwise translation is terminated or Firefly is translated in the wrong coding frame. Two T2A peptides separate both luciferases from the aptamer+frameshift switch and each other to prevent interfering expression signals.
                                        This measurement device will allow us to test the aptamer’s efficiency and determine its optimal conditions, as well as whether its documented functionality is experimentally replicable.

                                  <li><b>Partial sequence limitation:</b> The predictions of the swich states were not based on the <b>entire mRNA transcript</b>. Complex interactions with other transcript regions might exist but were beyond our computational capacity to model.</li>
                                    
                                  <li><b>RNAFold accuracy trade-offs:</b> As discussed in the <b>Design</b> section, RNAFold cannot predict <b>non-canonical pairings</b> due to training limitations. Our <b>Functional RNA Element (FRE)</b>, SECIS, relies on these pairings for readthrough induction. The software prioritised candidates maintaining SECIS key pairings in the ON state, but RNAFold could only predict one of four key pairings. Thus, ON–ON candidate selection relied mainly on a <b>partial set of non-canonical interactions</b>. This likely explains why the <b>predicted swich behaviour diverged from experimental outcomes</b>.</li>
                                </ul>
                                    
                                <p>Having learned this, we can verify that our <b>Model and Software</b> enable <b>automatised design of RNA switch candidates</b> with high success rates — in our case, all four candidate designs functioned as swiches, marking a <b>100% success rate</b>. Limitations stem mainly from current <b>bioinformatic prediction tools</b> like RNAFold, which cannot fully represent RNA complexity.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Despite this, our software <b>efficiently narrows down potential candidates</b> and significantly <b>accelerates swich development</b>. Naturally, differences between in silico designs and in vitro tests are expected due to these constraints.</p>
                                    
                                <p>In future iterations, we plan to design <b>shorter linkers</b> to achieve higher readthrough differences between <b>ON–OFF</b> and <b>OFF–ON</b> states, and to test additional candidates to achieve a true <b>ON–ON switch</b>. We are also considering expanding our <b>Model and Software</b> to include <b>non-canonical pairing recognition</b>, and to positively score those that contribute to the swich’s function.</p>
